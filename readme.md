### Usage

To use DarkXDPatcher and apply the dark theme to Adobe XD, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Adobe XD is closed before proceeding.

2. Locate the `General.xaml` file that you want to modify in your Adobe XD installation directory. By default, it is typically located in `C:/WindowsApps/Adobe.XD_[Random version number]/theme/General.xaml`.

3. Prepare the dark theme file (`dark.yaml`) that you want to apply. Ensure that it is in the correct format and contains the desired dark theme configurations.

4. Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt to execute DarkXDPatcher and apply the dark theme to your `General.xaml`:

```shell
node patcher.js
```

6. DarkXDPatcher will generate two output files: `output.yaml` and `outputBlack.yaml`. These files will contain the modified theme configurations.

7. Locate the `output.yaml` file generated by DarkXDPatcher. This file will replace the original `General.yaml` file in the `C:/WindowsApps/Adobe.XD_[Random version number]/theme/` directory.

**Note:** Before replacing the `General.yaml` file, it is recommended to create a backup of the original file to ensure that you can revert the changes if needed.

8. Copy the content of `output.yaml` and replace the content of the original `General.yaml` file located in `C:/WindowsApps/AdobeXd/theme/`.

9. Launch Adobe XD, and the dark theme should be applied.
